# Checklist for Completing the Practical Implementation
### Aligned with ADD / Domain-Based Scalability Assessment

---

## 1. Domain-Based Metric Pipeline

### 1. Baseline Selection & Computation
- [ ] Select baseline SUT (already enforced).
- [ ] For each API operation:
    - [ ] Compute baseline mean `x_j(λ0)` using lowest-load run.
    - [ ] Compute baseline standard deviation `σ_j(λ0)`.
    - [ ] Compute baseline threshold `φ_j = x_j + 3σ_j`.
- [ ] Store thresholds per operation.

### 2. Pass/Fail Evaluation
- [ ] For each SUT and each load level:
    - [ ] Compare mean response time with threshold.
    - [ ] Assign pass/fail (1/0).
    - [ ] Compute call fraction `δ_j` using `totalRequests`.

### 3. Fraction of Successful Operations
- [ ] For each load level `λ`:
    - [ ] Compute
      ```
      ŝ(λ) = Σ (δ_j * c_j)
      ```
    - [ ] Store `ŝ(λ)` for every SUT and load.

### 4. Domain-Based Metric `D(α,S)`
- [ ] Combine results using operational profile weights:
